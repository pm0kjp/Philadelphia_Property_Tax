# A Few Visualization Experiments

## Census Tracts Map

With thanks to John Alexis Guerra GÃ³mez and his [GeoJson map of Columbia](https://bl.ocks.org/john-guerra/43c7656821069d00dcbc), I was able to come up with a D3 visualization of Philadelphia Census Tracts (https://bl.ocks.org/pm0kjp/raw/0e4cfe763c51fd6061ff59b0b5d52545/)
