# Philadelphia Property Tax

A study of overdue property taxes in Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, USA

The goal of this project is to allow us to understand how the more aggressive pursuit of overdue property taxes could affect Philadelphia school funding.

## Where do Philadelphia schools get their income?

"The district is getting 55 percent of the city's property tax revenues, almost $666 million in the current fiscal year. It also is receiving about $34 million this year from the school income tax, $135 million from business use and occupancy taxes, $59 million from a liquor-by-the-drink tax, and additional non-tax revenues from Parking Authority and stadium agreements.  

This year it also started receiving revenue from the city's decision to permanently boost its sales tax to 8 percent, as well as from the city's new $2-a-pack levy on cigarettes. The District gets no funds from the city wage tax.

All told, the Mayor's Office of Education estimates that the district gets more than 41 percent of its local revenue from sources other than the property tax."
