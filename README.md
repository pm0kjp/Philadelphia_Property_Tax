# Philadelphia Property Tax

A study of overdue property taxes in Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, USA

The goal of this project is to allow us to understand patterns of property tax deliquency and how the more aggressive pursuit of overdue property taxes could affect Philadelphia's budget problems, especially its school funding.

## Background

The City of Philadelphia (which is also a county) is one of the nation's poorest large cities, [according to The Pew Charitable Trusts](http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/mayor/295762921.html). With a poverty rate over 25% and large areas of the city experiencing blight, it is more important than ever that property taxes be collected promptly and correctly, to bolster city schools ([which receive 55% of property tax, and are struggling](http://crossroads.newsworks.org/index.php/local/keystone-crossroads/81319-when-it-comes-to-education-funding-whats-the-deal-with-philly-schools)).  and other important city budgets.  However, property tax delinquency has been largely ignored and unenforced.  A [Philadelphia Inquirer investigation](http://planphilly.com/articles/2013/03/09/part-one-lax-property-tax-enforcement-and-brazen-deadbeat-investors-have-depressed-philadelphia-s-property-tax-base-by-9-5-billion) in 2013 shows that at least 59% of delinquent properties are owned by investors, not poverty-stricken families unable to pay.

## Rationale for this project:  

I want to create data visualizations that demonstrate the scope of the property tax delinquency crisis in the City of Philadelphia, including:

* D3 visualizations that show the worst offenders (by amount owed) and the number of properties owned by these worst offenders (highlighting the problem of delinquent investors)
* D3 or Google Chart time-series animations that show the increasing impact of non-enforcement over time
* Sankey charts (in D3?) that demonstrate where money generated by more effective enforcement could be channeled into struggling public schools

## A Few Pertinent Details

### Where do Philadelphia schools get their income?

"The district is getting 55 percent of the city's property tax revenues, almost $666 million in the current fiscal year. It also is receiving about $34 million this year from the school income tax, $135 million from business use and occupancy taxes, $59 million from a liquor-by-the-drink tax, and additional non-tax revenues from Parking Authority and stadium agreements.  

This year it also started receiving revenue from the city's decision to permanently boost its sales tax to 8 percent, as well as from the city's new $2-a-pack levy on cigarettes. The District gets no funds from the city wage tax.

All told, the Mayor's Office of Education estimates that the district gets more than 41 percent of its local revenue from sources other than the property tax."

### How much property tax is overdue in Philadelphia?

One [source](http://www.phillymag.com/citified/2015/07/01/philadelphia-tax-delinquency-lien-sale/) put the figure at around $500 million.

## Data Sources:

A geojson file can be found at [Philadelphia's Open Data website](https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/census-tracts/resource/7f62ef54-6e24-4c94-9542-cd141172580f).  Note that it is invalid geojson as it has a stray character as the first character.  A cleaned version (with the "d" invalid character removed) can be found in this repository.

Philadelphia's Open Data site also has a [large dataset of property tax deliquents]
(https://data.phila.gov/api/views/4v5pqi2q/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD&bom=true).
